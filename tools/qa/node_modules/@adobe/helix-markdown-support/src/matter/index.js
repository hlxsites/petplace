/**
 * Front- and mid-matter remark plugin.
 *
 * Frontmatter looks like this:
 *
 * ```
 * ---
 * Foo: bar
 * ---
 * ```
 *
 * The frontmatter is delimited by a `thematicBreak` made from three
 * dashes in the mdast and contains a yaml-encoded payload.
 *
 * Not any yaml and any thematicBreak is accepted; in order to avoid
 * false positives, the following restrictions apply:
 *
 * - There must be the start or end of the document or an empty line (`\n\n`)
 *   before and after the frontmatter block
 * - There may be no empty line within the frontmatter block; not even lines
 *   containing only whitespace
 * - The yaml must yield an object (as in key-value pairs); strings, numbers or
 *   arrays are not considered to be frontmatter in this context
 * - The thematic break must be made up of three dashes
 *
 * For frontmatter blocks at the beginning of the document, the rules are a bit
 * looser, as there is less risk of confusion:
 * - There may be no leading line within the frontmatter block
 * - There must be end of the document or an empty line (`\n\n`) after the
 *   frontmatter block
 * - The yaml must yield an object (as in key-value pairs); strings, numbers or
 *   arrays are not considered to be frontmatter in this context
 * - The thematic break must be made up of three dashes
 *
 * # Future directions
 *
 * This function is likely to change in the following ways:
 *
 * - Relaxed restrictions on what constitutes frontmatter.
 * - The ability to specify custom formats; by specifying the name
 *   of the format explicitly we reduce ambiguity to pretty much zero
 *   and can allow for far more complex frontmatter formats.
 *
 *    ```
 *    ---json
 *    {"foo": 42}
 *    ---
 *    ```
 *
 * # Ambiguous Frontmatter
 *
 * Normally, when one of the conditions above is triggered,
 * (e.g. Frontmatter containing an empty line; not being an array
 * instead of an object), a warning will be emitted instead of the
 * frontmatter being actually parsed & returned.
 * This warning may be processed by the caller in any way; e.g. by
 * printing a warning on the console or by throwing an error...
 *
 * In order to avoid ambiguous cases, the format described above
 * should be used for valid frontmatter; in order to use horizontal
 * rules unambiguously, the markdown author should either use symbols
 * other than dash to mark horizontal rules, or leave at least one empty
 * line before and after the three dashes.
 *
 * Both ways are guaranteed to be interpreted as horizontal rules and
 * never yield warnings.
 *
 * @param {object} options Plugin options
 * @param {Function} options.errorHandler Function that is invoked on yaml parsing errors.
